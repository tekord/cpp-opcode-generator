# Opcode constant generator for C++

This script generates C++ header file with opcode constants based on YAML file definition. It may be useful for virtual machine developers. Defining opcodes in external file instead of direct C++ enum has some advantages:

1. It is easier to read. Definition file contains only relevan information, no C++ code.
2. You can automate the building of documentation.
3. Opcode definition is isolated from your virtual machine implementation, so you can use it in non-C++ implementation
(of course you'll have to modify this script a little bit).

## Installation

This script uses `pyyaml` package. Make sure this package is installed on your machine. To install it execute the following command:

```
pip install pyyaml
```

## Usage

Copy `opcodes.example.yaml` file to your application's folder, define all opcodes you need in this file. Then run the script with specified input and output files like this:

```
/path/to/script/main.py path/to/opcodes.yaml opcodes.hpp
```

The first argument is a path to file with opcodes. The second argument is a C++ header file name which will be generated by the script. The result constant list may look like this:

```cpp
enum _GeneratedOpCodes {
    OPCODE_NOP = 0x00,
    OPCODE_B = 0xA0,
    OPCODE_BZ = 0xA1,
    OPCODE_B_FALSE = 0xA1 /* alias for BZ */,
    OPCODE_B_ZERO = 0xA1 /* alias for BZ */,
    OPCODE_B_NULL = 0xA1 /* alias for BZ */,
    OPCODE_BNZ = 0xA2,
    OPCODE_B_TRUE = 0xA2 /* alias for BNZ */,
    OPCODE_B_NOT_ZERO = 0xA2 /* alias for BNZ */,
    OPCODE_B_NOT_NULL = 0xA2 /* alias for BNZ */
};
```
